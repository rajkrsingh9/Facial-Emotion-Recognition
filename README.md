# Facial Emotion Recognition System

A facial emotion recognition system developed using deep learning techniques to accurately detect and classify human emotions in real-time. This project utilizes Python, OpenCV, Tensorflow, and DeepFace libraries.

## Features

- Real-time emotion detection through video feed or static images.
- Recognizes various emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and more.
- High accuracy achieved by fine-tuning the neural network and optimizing model architecture.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- Keras
- DeepFace

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    https://github.com/rajkrsingh9/Facial-Emotion-Recognition.git
    cd Facial-Emotion-Recognition
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   
3. Install the required libraries:

## Usage

1. Ensure you have a webcam connected for real-time emotion detection.
2. Run the emotion recognition script:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```
3. The system will start capturing video from your webcam and display the detected emotions in real-time.

## How It Works

- The system uses OpenCV for image processing and capturing video feed from the webcam.
- DeepFace library is used for face detection and emotion recognition.
